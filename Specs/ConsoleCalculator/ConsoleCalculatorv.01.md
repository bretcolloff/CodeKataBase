# Console Calculator Version 0.1

## Requirements
We require a class that implements the core functionality of a calculator, with which we can interact inside a C# application, but the interaction is out of scope of the development at this point.

## Functionality
In this section we describe the desired functionality.

### Addition
The addition function should take 2 integers and return the result of their addition.
 > Eg. A = 1, B = 2, result = A + B = 3
### Multiplication
The multiplication function should take 2 integers and return the result of their multiplication.
> Eg. A = 7, B = 6, result = A * B = 42
### Division
The division function should take 2 integers and return the result of the first integer divided by the second integer.
> Eg. A = 10, B = 2, result = A / B = 5
### Subtraction
The subtraction function should take 2 integers and return the result of the second integer being subtracted from the first integer.
> Eg. A = 10, B = 1, result = A â€“ B = 9

## Testing
Unit testing for the application should be thorough and at the discretion of the developer or testers responsible. For the functionality required, consider the possible edge cases we might want to specify and validate.
